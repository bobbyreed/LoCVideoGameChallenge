Working repo for my entry into the LoC Friends Video Game Challenge

### 6/29 - Researching narratives using LoC Research Guides
1. Researched possible narratives using the resource list provided in the challenge. I found gold when I pulled up the LoC research guides. From there I narrowed down by possible narratives inspired by:
2. An Act Establishing Yellowstone National Park
3. Airmail: Topics in Chronicling America
4. Alaska Purchase Treaty: Primary Documents in American History
5. Eight Hour Day (1916): Topics in Chronicling America
6. Golden Flyer Suffragettes: Topics in Chronicling America
7. Louisiana Purchase: Primary Documents in American History
8. Yo Soy (I am): The Historical Trajectory of Language in Puerto Rico

I particularly like Yellowstone and the Golden Flyer on first glance, so I tried to work from the guide to develop a map of requirements for translating these resources into a game that focuses on learning outcomes. With my background in lit, it is no surprise that Iâ€™m hoping to find resonant human stories to encourage the retention of learning outcomes.
